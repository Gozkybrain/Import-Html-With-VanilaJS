# HOW TO IMPORT CONTENTS WITH HTML

There was initially no way around this in the past, even till date you need to utilize some Javascript knowledge to achieve this concept.

There are is an effective to import HTML just as we would do in react.

## The Include Method
This method uses a concept to fetch data from a designated page, eg. content.html and define it by a tag eg. <geebrain />  using javascript eg. include.js, and then include it in any html page that has the script tag.

There may be other methods, but this happens to be my personal favorite because i get to preview my pages before importing.
